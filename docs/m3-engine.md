# M3 — the fast engine: x86-64 → WASM JIT

## Why this is the core project

The current engine (v86) JIT-translates 32-bit x86 to WASM and is fast
enough to boot a distro kernel in seconds and run Xorg + GIMP 2.x. It will
never run an AppImage: AppImages are x86-64, and v86 stops at 32 bits.

Today exactly one engine in the world JITs x86 in the browser at usable
speed for 64-bit-era desktop software: CheerpX. It is proprietary. The open
alternatives (Bochs, TinyEMU under WASM) are interpreters, 10–100× slower.
So the open slot oxwasm must fill is precisely: **an open-source x86-64 →
WASM JIT**. Everything else in oxwasm is packaging around whichever engine
sits in this slot.

## Architecture (target)

```
guest pages ──> decoder ──> basic blocks ──> IR (light SSA) ──> wasm emit
                   ^                                               │
                   └────────── invalidation on self-mod write <────┘
                                (page-granular, like v86)
```

- **Tier 0**: interpreter for cold code, boot paths, and correctness oracle.
- **Tier 1**: per-basic-block baseline JIT — direct x86→wasm lowering,
  registers pinned to wasm locals, flags computed lazily (the classic
  trick; v86 and CheerpX both live on it).
- **Memory**: guest physical memory = one big `WebAssembly.Memory`; 64-bit
  guest virtual addressing via software TLB (inline check + slow-path
  call). Memory64 removes masking overhead when it's everywhere.
- **New modules per code region**, swapped in via table patching —
  `WebAssembly.Module` instantiation is cheap enough at block granularity
  (v86 proves this in production).
- **SIMD**: SSE2 maps well onto wasm SIMD128. x87 through softfloat.

## Sequencing

1. Long mode decode + tier-0 interpreter, validated against a differential
   harness (same instruction stream through qemu-user / hardware, compare
   architectural state per block). The harness is the real asset: it makes
   every later tier honest.
2. Tier-1 for the hot 20 opcodes; measure on GIMP's actual startup trace.
3. Syscall-level fast path: once the JIT runs userspace well, a Linux
   syscall emulation layer (the M4 kernel surface) can skip the guest
   kernel entirely for AppImages — processes become workers, and the two
   lanes converge.

## Interim engine posture

`oxwasm build` keeps a pluggable engine: v86 today; a Bochs-class x86-64
interpreter could make `oxwasm gimp.AppImage` *literal* before it is
*usable*, at the cost of minutes-long startup — worth it only as a CI
correctness target, not as the demo. The JIT is the product.
